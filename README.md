# Purpose
I built this website as my fifth and final project for the code institutes full stack development and e-commerce applications course. 
I built this website from scratch using the Django framework and the knowledge I gained while studying at the code institute where I have learned the basics of Python, HTML, Javascript and CSS.

# Target audience
* Football Fans
* Shirt Collectors 
* Fashion lovers 

# User Experience 

<br>

## Site Aims

* Provide football lovers with a store to purchase classic football shirts.
* Get as many users signed up as possible. 
* Create a good relationship with customers and keep them returning. 

# Design 

## Agile Methodology 
The agile methodology was implemented in the design of this project. The project was planned on github using the project board feature.
* You can find the project board [Here](https://github.com/users/Mcdaid101/projects/3).
* The project board consists of three sections: 
* 1. Todo 
* 2. In progress 
* 3. Done.
* Each user story was drawn up in the issues section of github and passed on to the kanban where once added to the project board, it was placed in the todo section. Once a user story was undertaken it was then moved into "in progress"section and when finally implemented and complete moved into the third.

# Business Model 
Foot Galaxy's Business model is a Business to customer model. As Foot galaxy aims to sell products directly to consumers. See below the techniques Foot Galaxy use to implement their business model and boost sales and growth. 

# Search engine optimization
For SEO I searched Wordtracker.com for my keywords which I included in the meta tags to promote SEO. I entered these words into google and compared them to the sites and words that would come up along wit the "People also searched for" sections. I then added what I thought were the most relevant to my meta tags and added them as much as possile in my site. 

## Robots.txt and Sitemap
To further boost SEO I created a robots.txt file and added a sitemap along side this which I downloaded from XML-sitemaps.com.

# Marketing

* Marketing at Foot Galaxy will be mainly done through social media as it is a large Business to customer company. The store runs a facebook page titled Foot Galaxy and shoppers can find out more about the store there and receive any updates on new deals and future events.

## Design choices 
<br>

### Colour scheme
The colour scheme of the website is a simple white with flashes of red in the background, easy on the eye and stylish and modern. When the site is viewed on a device on dark mode, the colour scheme automatically switches from white to black, along with the font from black to white. This is a feature of tailwind's css. 

### Dark mode contrast

![Dark mode](static/images/dark%20mode2.png)

### Font 
The font for this site is the generic arial sans serif, a classic font that works well on all sites. I observed it was used across most modern websites and e commerce stores and implemented it here also.

# Bugs 


<br>

* Grandtotal not appearing on the order confirmation message after checkout. strange bug as it appears in the checkout and bag pages, will get to the bottom of it in the future. More torublshooting needed as this is a big problem for shoppers who will want to be reminded of what they paid. 

<br>

* After uploading my media files to AWS they still failed to render on the live site, the directory that the images were in were wrong, placing the images in the correct directory quickly fixed this. 

<br>

![Terminal Bugs ](static/images/terminal%20bugs.png)
* The css bug appeared at end of devlopment, unsure of the cause have extensively tried to fix and no matter what info I have found on trying to rectify it does not work. Further troublshooting will be required to remove. 

# Testing and validation

<br>

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
* Passed the pages through the W3C HTML and CSS validators
* Passed the project through a pep8 linter and the Code Institute python checker and confirmed there is no problems.
* Tested in my gitpod terminal and the Heroku terminal.
* Tested each user story to make sure each one passes. 

W3C validations
* The w3c HTML validators pulled up alot of issues to do with django syntax, any that were not django I quickly corrected. 
![HTML](static/images/html%20validator.png)
![HTML](static/images/html%20validator%203.png)
![HTML](static/images/inputslash.png)

Pep8
* Some errors still remain (lines too long) bar this no other major errors were returned from the code institute's python Linter. Ran out of time in development will return in the future to indent the code.
![Python](static/images/pythonlinter.png)

Lighthouse testing
* The lighthouse testing for the site did not score the best due to the large storage size of the images and other features, this is something to work on. 
 ![Lighthouse test mobile](static/images/lighthouse-mobile.png)
 ![Lighthouse test desktop](static/images/lighthousedesktop.png)

<br>

Unit tests
* Some unit tests have been implemented, ultimately ran out of time in development. More testing will take place at a future date. 

# Deployment 

## Creating this project
This project was created by navigating to the Code Institute's Gitpod student template and clicking the 'use this template' button. I then inputted the repository name "Foot Galaxy" and included all branches. With the repository now created, I used the browser version of Vs Code to create the project. 
<br>



I used the following commands throughout this project:
* Git add . - This added my file to the staging area to be committed
* Git commit -m - This command committed any changes to the local repository along with a message
* Git push - pushed my changes to the github repository and to Heroku 
* git reset --hard HEAD^ - This removed my last commit 
* python3 manage.py runserver - This ran my code in the terminal
* python3 manage.py makemigrations - This made my migrations
* python3 manage.py migrate - This migrated my changes to my databases
* pip3 freeze > requirements.txt.

## Heroku
This website is deployed on Heroku

## Steps for deployment 
* Fork or clone this repository
* Linked the heroku app to the repository via github
* Clicked automatic deploys so each git push would automatically go to the heroku app
* This was ideal for testing so I could see what the site looked like on the Heroku terminal with each git push

<p> 1. Create Django project and app </p>

* Install django using the command pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
* Then install the database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2, using pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
* Then create the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
* Then created my Django project with the command django-admin startproject project_name .
* I created the Django app with the command python3 manage.py startapp app_name
* I used the commands python3 manage.py makemigrations and python3 manage.py migrate to migrate my changes.
* To test and run the project I used python3 manage.py runserver.

<p> 2. Create Heroku app </p>

* I opened the heroku website and logged into my account
* I created a new app with the project name
* Select region as Europe
* Open the Resources section and select Heroku Postgres
* Open the Settings section and select Config VARS, then add the necessary keys to your project. 

<p> 3. Set up Django settings.py and necessary folders/files </p>

         from pathlib import Path
         import os
         import dj_database_url
         from django.contrib.messages import constants as messages
         if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
         import env
         
* Inside INSTALLED_APPS I added the necessary apps

      
* Create a Procfile and add the following text

web: gunicorn autoclassic.wsgi

<p> 4. Elephant SQL</p>

* Login to site 
* Click 'Create New Instance' then select a region.
* Confirm new instance by clicking 'Create Instance'.
* Click the instance you created, copy the URL.

* Sign in to stripe.
* Go to 'Developers' then 'API Keys' to view public and secret key.
* Copy and paste your STRIPE_PUCLIC_KEY AND STRIPE_SECERET_KEY into heroku convig vars.

<p> 6. Amazon web services AWS </p>

* Log in to AWS
* Create bucket in s3 select a Region turn off block all Public access go to the static website hosting' and click edit.
* In permissions click edit on CORS then edit bucket policy and generate and set configuration bucket policy. 
* On access control list set list object permission for everyone.
* Open IAM application and set up a user group.
* Click on policies and create policy THEN click on the JSON tab and import a pre-built Amazon policy called AmazonS3FullAccess.
